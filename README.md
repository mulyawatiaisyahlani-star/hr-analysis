# Dummy Project of HR Case
This project looks at a synthetic HR dataset of 10,000 employees to understand people-related challenges in an integrated agribusiness company. On the surface, the business seems to be running well—production is on track, operations are stable, and brands remain competitive. However, a closer look at the data reveals early warning signs, such as higher employee turnover in certain roles and tenure groups, uneven performance patterns across departments, and potential gaps in pay and inclusion.

The main challenge is that these issues don’t point to one clear cause. Instead, they sit at the intersection of attrition, performance, compensation, and workforce demographics. From an HR perspective, this analysis aims to make those patterns easier to understand and turn complex data into insights that support better people decisions, before these issues start affecting productivity, costs, and long-term talent sustainability.
# Project Goals
1. Identify key drivers of employee attrition and retention risks.
2. Assess performance gaps and strengths across business units.
3. Evaluate compensation fairness and market competitiveness.
4. Uncover diversity and inclusion insights through workforce demographics.
5. Deliver data-driven recommendations to support strategic HR decisions.
# Project Process
1. Reviewed the dataset to check for missing values, standardized inconsistent entries, and created clear category groupings for attrition, tenure, salary, and age.
2. Analyzed patterns and relationships between variables using pivot-based analysis to uncover meaningful insights from the data.
3. Translated insights into actions for each project goal by applying an Insight-to-Action framework to develop strategic, data-driven HR recommendations.

# Project Insight
1. Overall attrition stands at 11.88%, with significantly higher turnover in Farm Operations and Food Processing, indicating retention risks in core operational functions.
2. Employees with 0–2 years of tenure experience the highest attrition (17.25%), highlighting early tenure as a critical retention phase.
3. Low compensation is a key driver of turnover, as employees earning below USD 50,000 show a substantially higher attrition rate (20.35%).
4. Employees with lower performance ratings (1–2) have higher attrition, with roles such as Farm Supervisor, Agronomist, and Farm Worker being the most vulnerable.
5. Marketing & Sales and R&D show higher concentrations of low performance ratings, while Food Processing consistently demonstrates the strongest performance outcomes.
6. Salary levels generally align with education, role, performance, and tenure, but gender-based pay disparities exist, particularly affecting non-binary employees.
7. Younger employees (ages 18–30) and those with a high school education exhibit higher attrition, signaling early-career retention challenges.
8. Field-based roles receive the lowest average salaries, which may limit talent attraction and retention in operational environments.
# Strategic Recommendation
1. Prioritize early-tenure retention (0–2 years) in Farm Operations and Food Processing through improved pay competitiveness for roles below USD 50k.
2. Strengthen structured onboarding (3–6 months) and early check-ins to stabilize productivity and reduce turnover in critical operational roles.
3. Implement targeted capability development for underperforming units, particularly Marketing & Sales, to address skill and alignment gaps.
4. Adopt performance management and talent practices from high-performing departments (e.g., Food Processing) to improve consistency across units.
5. Conduct a focused compensation equity review to address identified pay anomalies, especially for non-binary employees and select entry-level roles.
6. Strengthen market benchmarking and clarify salary progression paths to improve fairness, transparency, and retention.
7. Integrate diversity and inclusion considerations into retention and compensation strategies, with emphasis on early-career and underrepresented employees.
8. Support inclusive culture through mentoring, fair pay practices, and bias-aware people processes to sustain long-term engagement.
